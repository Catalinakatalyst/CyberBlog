# Threat Map Image Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the threat map image referenced in the threat-hunting.md blog post.

In a real deployment, you would place an actual threat map image file here:
/images/threat-map.png

For now, this text file serves as a placeholder to maintain the directory structure.
